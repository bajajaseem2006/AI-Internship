2. **Demo the form features**:
   - Show skill selection (type and click suggestions)
   - Show sector interest selection
   - Point out category selection for fairness
   - Highlight aspirational district option

3. **Register a new student** (use these sample details):
   ```
   Name: Demo Student
   Email: demo@example.com
   College: Demo University
   Degree: B.Tech CSE
   Year: 3
   Skills: Python, Machine Learning, Data Science
   Location Preference: Delhi
   Sector Interests: AI/ML, Data Science
   Category: SC (to show fairness)
   Aspirational District: Yes
   ```

4. **Submit and view matches**:
   - Form should redirect to results automatically
   - **Expected result**: Top matches with scores and fairness indicators
   - **Point out**: Higher scores for relevant matches, quota eligibility shown

5. **Test existing student matches**:
   - Go to "View Results" page
   - Enter Student ID: 1 (Aarav Sharma)
   - Set results to 5, strategy to "Score Boost"
   - Click "Get Matches"
   - **Expected result**: Personalized matches with explanations

### Step 5: Company Experience (3 minutes)

1. **Navigate to Company Registration** → http://localhost:3000/company

2. **Register a new internship**:
   ```
   Company: Demo Tech Corp
   Email: hr@demotechcorp.com
   Sector: AI/ML
   Title: Machine Learning Intern
   Description: Work on cutting-edge ML projects with mentorship
   Required Skills: Python, Machine Learning, TensorFlow
   Location: Delhi
   Capacity: 3
   ```

3. **Show quota configuration**:
   - Click "Auto-fill Standard Quota"
   - **Explain**: Automatic calculation based on capacity (10% SC, 5% ST, 15% OBC, 2% PwD)

4. **Submit the internship**
   - **Expected result**: "Internship posted successfully!"

### Step 6: Batch Allocation (3 minutes)

1. **Return to Admin Panel** → "Batch Allocation" tab

2. **Configure allocation**:
   - Fairness Strategy: "Quota Enforcement"
   - **Explain difference**: Quota vs Score Boost strategies

3. **Run batch allocation**:
   - Click "Run Batch Allocation"
   - **Expected result**: "Batch allocation completed! X students allocated"

4. **View allocation results**:
   - Go to "Data Management" tab
   - Click "View Allocations"
   - **Show results**: Student-internship pairs with scores and quota categories
   - **Point out**: Fair distribution across categories

### Step 7: System Monitoring (2 minutes)

1. **Go to "Monitoring" tab** in Admin Panel

2. **Show system health**:
   - Backend API: Online
   - Database: Connected  
   - ML Model: Ready

3. **Show performance metrics**:
   - Total registrations
   - Successful allocations
   - Allocation rate percentage

4. **Highlight system stats**:
   - Database counts (students, internships, allocations)
   - Model artifacts status
   - Last training metrics

## Key Demo Points to Emphasize

### Technical Excellence
- **Real-time matching**: Instant results when students register
- **Scalable architecture**: Handles large datasets efficiently
- **Production ready**: Docker deployment, CI/CD, comprehensive testing

### Fairness & Inclusion
- **Reservation quotas**: Ensures representation for SC/ST/OBC/PwD
- **Bias-aware scoring**: Score boost for underrepresented students
- **Transparent process**: Clear explanation of why matches are suggested

### User Experience
- **Intuitive interface**: Easy-to-use forms and clear navigation
- **Immediate feedback**: Real-time validation and instant results
- **Comprehensive admin panel**: Complete system control and monitoring

## Troubleshooting

### If seeding fails:
```bash
cd backend
python seed_db.py --create-tables --students data/small_students.json --internships data/small_internships.json
```

### If model training fails:
```bash
cd backend
python train_model.py --model_type similarity
```

### If no matches appear:
1. Ensure database is seeded
2. Ensure model is trained
3. Check backend logs for errors

### If frontend won't load:
```bash
cd frontend
npm start
```

## Advanced Demo Features

### Generate Larger Dataset
```bash
cd backend
python data/generate_synthetic_data.py --students 100 --internships 20
```

### Performance Testing
- Show response times for batch allocation
- Demonstrate scalability with larger datasets
- Show evaluation metrics (Precision@K, Recall@K, MAP)

### API Demonstration
```bash
# Show direct API calls
curl http://localhost:5000/api/health
curl http://localhost:5000/api/match/student/1?k=5
```

## Questions & Answers

**Q: How does the fairness algorithm work?**
A: Two strategies - quota enforcement reserves specific slots for categories, while score boost adds points to underrepresented students' scores.

**Q: Can this scale to thousands of students?**
A: Yes, the system uses vectorized operations and can handle 1000+ students efficiently. Database can be switched to PostgreSQL for production.

**Q: How accurate is the matching?**
A: The similarity-based model achieves high precision for skill-matched positions. The system also supports supervised learning models for improved accuracy.

**Q: Is the system production-ready?**
A: Yes, includes Docker deployment, CI/CD pipeline, comprehensive tests, security measures, and monitoring capabilities.
